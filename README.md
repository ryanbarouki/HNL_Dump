# HNL Dump
Beam dump simulation for heavy neutral leptons (HNLs)

## Link to paper
Our results can be found in our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00416

## How to run
The main scripts are `get_upper_bounds.py` and `non_linear_calc.py`. Add the `-h` or `--help` when running these scripts to find out how to use them.
These are used to get the upper and lower bounds of the mixing.
